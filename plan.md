# Plan 

## Generate data
- Run simulations for different refractiove indices 
    - OTT or Neural Net simulations?
      - Amount of data needed?
      - How many refractive indices?
        - Chosen arbitrarily or specific values?
      - Verification of simulation
        - Level of accuracy? Cascading error?

## Features 
- Forces or forces and positons? (other variables?)
    - Parsimony?
- Time ordered?
  - Accuracy benefits, training time, memory?
  - What information does time ordering capture?
    - How much past information is valuable?
  - Data generation
## Outputs
- Refractive index
  - Other variables (particle size?)
- How do refractive indices vary?
  - Do only specific values matter corresponding to materials?
- Varying in time refractive index?

## Network Architecture 
- Type of network
- Layers, nodes, connectivity 
- More modern Architecture
