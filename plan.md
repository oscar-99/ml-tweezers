# Plan 

## Generate data
- Run simulations for different refractiove indices 
    - OTT or Neural Net simulations?
      - Amount of data needed?
      - How many refractive indices?
        - Chosen arbitrarily or specific values
      - Verification of simulation
        - Level of accuracy? Cascading error?
  - Features
