# Summary 
- Got simulation working to generate some data using trained 5 degree of freedom model 
- Reading up on Neural Networks particularly convolutional neural networks and image classification.  
- Built a simple MLP model to help learn how keras works and how to process the generated data.
- Shifted reading focus to time series classification/regression.
- Reading leads to ResNet model and Deep learning. Begin process of building and training ResNet.
